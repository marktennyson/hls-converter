## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release

#### Added

**Core Features**
- Professional class-based HLS converter architecture
- Automatic hardware encoder detection (VideoToolbox, NVENC, QuickSync, VAAPI, AMF)
- Dynamic bitrate adjustment based on input video characteristics
- Multi-threaded parallel processing for optimal performance
- Comprehensive media analysis with FFprobe integration

**Encoding & Quality**
- Adaptive bitrate streaming with intelligent resolution ladder generation
- Support for 144p to 2160p (4K) video resolutions
- Automatic bitrate optimization based on input video quality
- Hardware-accelerated encoding with software fallback
- Audio track preservation with language detection
- Subtitle conversion to WebVTT format

**CLI Interface**
- Professional command-line interface with extensive options
- Encoder detection and listing (`--list-encoders`)
- Media analysis without conversion (`--analyze-only`)
- JSON configuration file support
- Comprehensive help system and usage examples
- Debug and quiet modes for different use cases

**Developer API**
- Clean, well-documented Python API
- Modular architecture with separate components
- Rich console logging with progress tracking
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

**Documentation**
- Professional MkDocs documentation with Material theme
- Comprehensive API reference with examples
- Step-by-step installation and quick start guides
- CLI reference with all options and examples
- Advanced usage patterns and integration examples

#### Technical Specifications

**Supported Input Formats**
- MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, M4V and other FFmpeg-supported formats
- H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1 video codecs
- AAC, MP3, AC3, DTS audio codecs
- SRT, ASS, VTT, PGS, DVD subtitle formats

**Output Format**
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) with M3U8 playlists
- MPEG-TS segments with configurable duration
- Multi-bitrate adaptive streaming
- Audio-only tracks with language support
- WebVTT subtitles for text-based tracks

**System Requirements**
- Python 3.8+ 
- FFmpeg 4.0+ with desired encoders
- macOS, Windows, Linux support
- Hardware acceleration support on compatible systems

#### Architecture Improvements

**Compared to Legacy Version**
- âœ… **Class-based architecture** vs. procedural functions
- âœ… **Dynamic bitrate adjustment** vs. hardcoded bitrates  
- âœ… **Modular components** vs. monolithic script
- âœ… **Professional CLI** vs. basic argument parsing
- âœ… **Comprehensive testing** vs. no test coverage
- âœ… **Package distribution** vs. single script file
- âœ… **Rich documentation** vs. minimal comments
- âœ… **Error handling** vs. basic exception catching

#### Known Limitations

- Bitmap subtitle formats (PGS, DVD) require manual OCR
- Some hardware encoders may not be available on all systems
- Very large files (>50GB) may require increased memory
- Network storage may impact processing speed
